# [CSC510: Software Engineering] Term Project
We compared three deep learning libraries: Tensorflow (TF), CNTK, and Caffe2, using four approaches. A natural first place to look is the development community itself. To do this, we analyzed each library's GitHub repository using data from three sources: GitStats, GitTrends, and each repository's GitHub page itself. Secondly, to analyze the code quality and sustainability for the learning libraries, we utilized two static analysis tools: CppCheck,  and  CppDepend. Then, we evaluated the start-up cost for using each library as well as user experience, measured subjectively. This includes the readability of the source code and available documentation. Lastly, we compared efficiency (processing time) and effectiveness (prediction accuracy) of each library by training deep learning models, evaluated with benchmark datasets. This repository contains most of the data and results we obtained from our analyses.
